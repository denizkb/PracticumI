In this repository,

You can find the project I worked on GSS Data from 1972 to 2021 that lets users to

* view data by filtering by year(s) and selecting variable(s)
* download the filtered data as csv file
* view descriptive analysis and graphs of a selected single variable.


__Data_Preprocessing.Rmd__ : Filtered the original data by years and variables, converted variable types into factors and save as csv file.

__finaldata.csv__ : Filtered and coverted data

__finaldata.dta__ : Filtered original data

__ui.R__ and __server.R__ : Code for R shiny dashboard
